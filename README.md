# Workout-Tracker

*Date: 5th August, 2024*

Building a simple workout tracker for personal use. Each exercise will contain a Workout name, Date started, Dates worked out, Reps, sets and weights each time worked out and trends.

For now, all data will be stored in a csv file and data manipulation will be done using Pandas DataFrame. Do not attempt the trends part, leave that section alone for later.

**Future Scope**

- Add simple trend calculations like weight progress.
- Store all data in a database (Check with Karthik how, what, where).
- Create an iphone app for the same.
